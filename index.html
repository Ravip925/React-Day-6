      <h2>What is an event in react?</h2>
      <h5>
        An event is an action that could be triggered as a result of the user
        action or system generated event. For example, a mouse click, loading of
        a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, and other interactions are
        called events.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        React has its own event handling system which is very similar to
        handling events on DOM elements. The react event handling system is
        known as Synthetic Events. The synthetic event is a cross-browser
        wrapper of the browser's native event.

      <h2>What is the difference between states and props?</h2>
      <h3>Props:</h3>
      <h5>
        Props are known as properties it can be used to pass data from one
        component to another. Props cannot be modified, read-only, and
        Immutable.
      </h5>
      <h3>State:</h3>
      <h5>
        The state represents parts of an Application that can change. Each
        component can have its State. The state is Mutable and It is local to
        the component only. The state is a built-in React object that is used to
        contain data or information about the component. A component's state can
        change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders

      <h2>What is memory leak and how to overcome?</h2>
      <h5>
        Memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in heap and forget
        to delete it.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        The consequences of memory leak is that it reduces the performance of
        the computer by reducing the amount of available memory. Eventually, in
        the worst case, too much of the available memory may become allocated
        and all or part of the system or device stops working correctly, the
        application fails, or the system slows down vastly.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Memory leaks are particularly serious issues for programs like daemons
        and servers which by definition never terminate.

      <h2>Do you prefer function-based or class component and why ?</h2>
      <h5>
        Functional Component. A functional component is just a plain JavaScript
        pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React
        element(JSX). A class component requires you to extend from React.
        Component and create a render function which returns a React element.
        There is no render method used in functional components.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them Stateful.
        example: const [name,SetName]= React.useState(‘ ‘)
      </h5>

      <h2>Explain reducer as pure function in redux?</h2>
      <h5>
        In Redux, a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the
        previous state of the application and returns the new state. The action
        describes what happened and it is the reducer's job to return the new
        state based on that action. (previousState, action) => newState
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Reducers are the only way to change states in Redux. It is the only
        place where you can write logic and calculations. Reducer function will
        accept the previous state of app and action being dispatched, calculate
        the next state and returns the new object.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        The following few things should never be performed inside the reducer
      </h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Mutation of functions arguments</li>
        <li>API calls & routing logic</li>
        <li>Calling non-pure function e.g. Math.random()</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why do we use redux thunk?</h2>
      <h5>
        The most common use case for Redux Thunk is for communicating
        asynchronously with an external API to retrieve or save data. Redux
        Thunk makes it easy to dispatch actions that follow the lifecycle of a
        request to an external API. Redux Thunk is middleware that allows you to
        return functions, rather than just actions, within Redux. This allows
        for delayed actions, including working with promises. One of the main
        use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be
        synchronous, for example, using axios to send a GET request.

      <h2>What do you know about NPM?</h2>
      <h5>
        NPM stands for 'Node Package Module',npm is the world's largest software
        registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share
        and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private
        development as well.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language
        maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the
        JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line
        client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for
        private packages, called the npm registry.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        Most commonly, it is used to publish, discover, install, and develop
        node programs.
      </h5>
      <h5>
        The registry contains over 800,000 code packages. Open-source developers
        use npm to share software.
      </h5>
      <h5>npm consists of three distinct components:</h5>
      <ol>
        <li>The website</li>
        <li>The Command Line Interface (CLI)</li>
        <li>The registry</li>
      </ol>
